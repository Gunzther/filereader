	While it's running, the TaskTimer will measure the elapsed time.
	There are three File Reader classes.
	1) Read text from URL by using InputStreamReader and append it to String.
	2) Read text from URL by using InputStreamReader and append it to StringBuilder.
	3) Read text from URL by using BufferedReader and append lines to String.
